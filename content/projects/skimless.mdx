Skimless was my _final year project for my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Lagos._
I built it to help students and researchers quickly find answers to
questions in their PDFs, digital books, and articles. Having to read
through a whole document to find answers to specific questions can be
time-consuming and frustrating and I needed a solution to better
maximize my efficiency, hence the birth of Skimless.

## Methodology

The project integrates several technologies to create an
interactive, AI-powered Tool. **TypeScript** provides type safety, ensuring reliable code across components. **React.js and Next.js** form the frontend, handling dynamic content rendering and routing. **React-PDF** enables users to view and interact with PDFs directly within the
application. When a PDF is uploaded, **LangChain** chunks and embeds its content, storing these embeddings in **Pinecone Vectorstore (Database)** for fast, context-based retrieval. When users query the PDF, LangChain uses these embeddings to find relevant sections, and **GPT (an LLM/AI)** generates clear, human-like responses, enabling an engaging, responsive study experience.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge was integrating the various technologies to
create a seamless, interactive experience. I had to ensure that the
frontend and backend communicated effectively, and that the
application could handle large PDFs without slowing down. I also had
to ensure that the AI generated accurate, relevant responses to user
queries, which required extensive testing and tweaking to make sure
the response/s doesn't go outside the scope of the particular
document being queried.

## Results

Skimless has been a huge success, with users praising its speed,
accuracy, and ease of use. It has helped students and researchers
save time and effort when searching for answers in their documents,
and has received positive feedback from educators and industry
professionals alike. I am proud of what I have accomplished with
Skimless and look forward to continuing to improve and expand its
capabilities in the future.
