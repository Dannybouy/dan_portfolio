              <p>
                The journey for me began in secondary school when I did a
                subject called Basic Computer, I remember been fascinated about
                the multipurpose nature of computers and how they work in the
                basic form and how my brain just understood the subject.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was then I need what I was going to study in the university,
                I was confused at first but I knew I wanted to do something with
                computers, so I decided to study Computer Engineering because
                the combination of Computers + Engineering really excited me. I
                went to the university studied Computer Engineering for 5 years
                at the university of Lagos, and I graduated with a degree in
                computer engineering :)
              </p>
              <p>
                My journey into software engineering began in 2020 when I
                decided to start learning beyond the lecture room, took a
                frontend career path from scrimba and got my first internship in
                2022 and since then, I kept growing in my craft as a developer,
                engineer, and graphic designer in my spare time
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, I am 5 years in and my passion is stronger than when I
                first started.
